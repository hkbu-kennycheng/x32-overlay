# x32-overlay

This is a Gentoo Linux overlay repository (EAPI 8) named "x32-overlay" that extends the main Gentoo repository with custom package versions and patches for X32 ABI support.

## Overview

X32 is an ABI (Application Binary Interface) that allows programs to run in a 32-bit environment while taking advantage of 64-bit CPU features. This overlay provides ebuilds and patches to enable X32 support for various packages in Gentoo Linux.
